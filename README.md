# README for Traffic Volume Data Analysis

## Overview
This README outlines the process undertaken to clean, preprocess, and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing metro interstate traffic volume information. The dataset includes various environmental and temporal features alongside traffic volume counts. The primary goal is to prepare the dataset for analysis, identify patterns, relationships, and insights that could inform traffic management strategies or further predictive modeling.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The dataset underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and facilitate meaningful analysis:

### Renaming Columns
Column names were updated for clarity and consistency. For example, 'temp' was changed to 'temperature_kelvin' to reflect the unit of measurement accurately.

### Dropping Duplicates
Duplicate records, if any, were identified and removed from the dataset to prevent skewing the analysis.

### Handling Missing Values
Missing values were addressed appropriately, either by filling them with statistical measures (mean, median) or removing the rows/columns with excessive missing data, based on the context.

### Temperature Conversion
The temperature was originally recorded in Kelvin. It was converted to Fahrenheit for ease of interpretation and analysis, as Fahrenheit is a more commonly used temperature scale in several regions.

### Feature Extraction from Timestamp
New features were extracted from the 'date_time' column, including 'hour', 'day_of_week', and 'month' to facilitate time-based analysis.

### Creating New Categorical Features
Based on the temperature in Fahrenheit, a new categorical feature 'temp_category' was created to label temperatures as 'cold', 'moderate', or 'hot'.

### Lag Features
Lag features for traffic volume were created to incorporate the temporal aspect into the analysis, which could be particularly useful for predictive modeling.

### Mean Encoding
Categorical variables were mean-encoded based on the 'traffic_volume' to capture the relationship between categorical features and traffic volume.

### Outlier Detection
Outliers were detected and handled using statistical methods (e.g., Z-score) to ensure they do not adversely affect the analysis.

### Rechecking Missing Values
After the initial preprocessing steps, the dataset was scanned again for missing values to ensure completeness and readiness for analysis.

### Normalization
Numerical features were normalized using Min-Max scaling to ensure they are on the same scale, facilitating comparison and correlation analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Following data cleaning and preprocessing, the dataset was explored to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships:

- **Summary Statistics**: Provided an overview of the dataset, including mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical features.

- **Variable Distributions**: Visualized through histograms to understand the distribution and skewness of each numerical feature.

- **Correlation Analysis**: A heatmap was generated to identify relationships between variables, highlighting potential factors influencing traffic volume.

- **Temporal Patterns**: Traffic volume was analyzed across different times of the day, days of the week, and months to identify patterns in traffic flow.

- **Scatter Plots**: Used to explore the relationship between traffic volume and other variables, such as temperature, highlighting how environmental conditions might affect traffic density.

## Usage
The code and methodologies described herein are intended for traffic analysts, urban planners, and researchers looking to understand traffic dynamics and the impact of environmental conditions on traffic volume. The insights gained can help in devising traffic management strategies, infrastructure planning, and policy-making.
